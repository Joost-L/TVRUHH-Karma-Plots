# About
This is a data visualisation project for the videogame "the void rains upon her heart".
Specifically I aim to visualize how the distribution of gifts you receive per monster in this game is influenced by your 'karma' stat

# Example
This is the result for the gift distribution in normal story chapters. The height of each colored bar is the average rate at which this type of gift will show up. You can see that the total height approaches 3 which is the amount of gift slots a monster has.

# How to run
This project was made using rust. You can use it yourself by cloning this repository and then compiling this repo using the [rust compiler](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch01-01-installation.html).
